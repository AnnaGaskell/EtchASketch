This project was a doozy. The initial setup to make a grid was easier but once I had to make it dynamic, everything changed. I really struggled to find the information to input a value into the grid function as well as to add a slider and multiple functions to reset the grid and page. I will need to review and dive deeper into DOM manipulation to do better (and faster) for future projects. I tend to try to put a lot into single functions instead of letting different functions perform simple tasks and then just calling them forth, this project was good practice for that.
